# Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms

Specialization of Algorithms in Coursera by Tim Roughgarden and Stanford University.

The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: asymptotic ("Big-oh") notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), and randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts).

Repository Contains programing assignment implementaitons in python3 and Java. Additional information about the course, literature, videos and datasets can be found in https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer.
